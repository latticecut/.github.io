I am a senior AI engineer and manager, entrepreneur, educator, and investor. 

I am interested in the intersection of philosophy of science, machine learning and business strategy.

Currently I lead on machine learning at the [Mishcon de Reya Group](https://www.mishcon.com/), a leading British law firm. This work focuses on building the data science function and to initiate research into the emerging field of computational law[^MDR]. 

I was co-founder of [Satalia.com](https://www.satalia.com/), a global leader in enterprise Artificial Intelligence and one of the UK’s fastest-growing tech companies, whose clients include BT, DFS, DS Smith, PwC, Gigaclear, Tesco and Unilever. The company was acquired in 2021 by WPP Plc[^WPP], a British multinational communications, advertising, technology company headquartered in London. 

I was also on the founding team of venture backed [Wearepopup.com](http://wearepopup.com/) that created the first online platform to execute a fully automated commercial real estate license in the UK. 

I retain active research and teaching roles. I am a jointly appointed Associate Professor at the [HSBC PKU Business School](https://english.phbs.pku.edu.cn/) and the [UCL School of Management](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/) where I was inaugural Programme Director of the MSc in Business Analytics. 

I currently co/teach the following courses:

* [Predictive Analytics, MSc Business Analytics, UCL School of Management](http://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/business-analytics#overview)
* [Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Europe, MBA BiMBA PKU UCL](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/mba-peking-university)
* [Emerging Business Technologies, MBA BiMBA PKU UCL](https://en.bimba.pku.edu.cn/programmes/PKU_UCL_MBA/Curriculum_ucl/index.htm)
* [AI & Analytics, MSc Management, PKU HSBC Business School](https://www.pku.org.uk/)

In 2021 I was asked to mentor at the Royal Academy of Engineering[^RAE], having served as a member of the Special Group for Entrepreneurship for the British Computer Society. I have mentored at the Wayra Academy and Techstars London. Previous projects include helping set up [IDEALondon](https://www.idealondon.co.uk/) innovation centre with Cisco and DC Thomson, now in its seventh year with affiliated start-ups raising upwards of £350m. 

I actively advise several startups and provide executive coaching on machine learning strategy. Recent projects include working with Nesta, the Competition and Markets Authority and the London Mayors Office. 

Current research interests include the use of data in the practise of law, contracting systems, anticipative regulation, industry mapping, and data driven technology strategy. 

I am interested in creating value from science and developing relationships between commercial partners and academia.
