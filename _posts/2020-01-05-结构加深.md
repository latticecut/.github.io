[//]: # "## Preamble"
## 前言

[//]: # "I'm interested in examining aspects of Simon Wardley's mapping framework[^wardley2016] in greater detail."

我对详细研究 Simon Wardley地图框架的各个方面很有兴趣。

[//]: # "If you that don't know the background to this, you can begin reading [On being lost](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec) to learn more about it. Reading Chapters 2 and 3 will only take you an hour or so."

如果不了解背景，你可以点击阅读第1章 [迷路了](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec) 以了解更多信息。阅读第 2 章和第 3 章只需要一个小时左右。

[//]: # "To me, the appeal of this mapping framework is that it views a business (model) as a directed graph evolving in a space over time. I think this has lots of advantages over other things we commonly refer to as business models - but more on my various motivations later."

对我来说，这个地图框架的吸引力在于它将业务（模型）视为在空间中随时间演化的有向图。我认为这比我们通常称为商业模式的其他东西有更多优势——稍后会更多地介绍我的各种动机。

[//]: # "In this first post we're going to look at the notion of *structural deepening* - but first let's start by having a look at a map."

在第一篇文章中，我们将研究结构深化的概念——但首先让我们先看一张地图。


***

[//]: # "## The structure of invention"
## 发明的结构

[//]: # "These series of posts are about the evolution of technologies, and the transitions between competing technologies in the context of a business."

这些系列文章关于技术的演变，以及业务环境中竞争技术之间的转换。

[//]: # "This first post draws heavily on the work of W. Brian Arthur[^arthur2007]."

第一篇文章大量借鉴了 W. 布莱恩.亚瑟 的著作[^arthur2007]。

[//]: # "The x-axis of a Wardley Map (Figure 1 below) displays the maturity of a technology over its life cycle. The maturity is divided into four stages; `Genesis`, `Custom Build`, `Product`, `Utility`[^stages]."

Wardley 地图的 x 轴（下图 1）显示了技术在其生命周期内的成熟度。成熟度分为四个阶段；开创、定制、产品、公用事业[^stages]. 

[//]: # "[^stages]: Following [Wardley 2016](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/finding-a-new-purpose-8c60c9484d3b), Figure 76, it is *in principle* possible to measure the stage of maturity of a component by assessing the language used to describe the technology in the various corpora that refer to it. From academic publications, to patents in the `Genesis` stage, to technical standards documentation in the early `Product` stage and finally to marketing collateral, sales manuals and so forth at different stages of commercial development. Not all components need pass through every stage of development and I will ignore the details of measuring the x-position from corpora. It is assumed as given for now, including the number of stages, and I will write more on this in future posts."

[^stages]: 根据[2016年的Wardley](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/finding-a-new-purpose-8c60c9484d3b),图 76，*原则上来说*，可以通过评估语言来衡量组件的成熟度阶段，这些语言用于描述引用它的各种语料库中的技术。从学术出版物，到开创阶段的专利，再到早期产品阶段的技术标准文档，最后到商业发展不同阶段的营销资料、销售手册等。并非所有组件都需要经过每个开发阶段，我将忽略从语料库测量 x 位置的细节。目前的假设是给定的，包括阶段的数量，我会在以后的博客中写更多。

[//]: # "To start with, illustrated in Figure 1, we can see that a component moves from left to right as it matures. I will use the word *technology* and *component* interchangeably in this blog as a means to fulfill a purpose[^techdef]."

首先，如图 1 所示，我们可以看到逐渐成熟的组件会从左向右移动。我会在本博客中交替使用“技术”和“组件”一词，以此作为实现目的的手段[^techdef]。

[//]: # "[^techdef]: Following Arthur (2007 p. 276)[^arthur2007]  The word technology has two other legitimate meanings: a body of practices, activities and components, and “the totality of the means employed by a people to provide itself with the objects of material culture (Arthur, 2007, p. 276)[^arthur2007]."

[^techdef]:根据亚瑟(2007 276页)[^arthur2007] 技术一词还有另外两个合法含义：实践、活动和组成部分的主体，以及“一个民族用来为自己提供物质文化对象的手段的总和” （亚瑟，2007 年，第 276 页）[^arthur2007]。 

[//]: # "Initially, on the lefthand side in the `Genesis stage` the component has to be created for the first time. At this stage we don't have a full design but a proof of concept that demonstrates how we can create something that achieves a desired purpose."

最初，在开创阶段的左侧组件首次被创建。在这个阶段，我们没有完整的设计，但有一个可证的概念来展示我们的东西如何创建实现预期目的。

[//]: # "**Figure 1. Map showing the evolution of a component through 4 stages, from Genesis to Commodity.**"
![Figure 1](/assets/zh/2020-01-05/fig01.png)
**图 1. 显示组件从开创到产品的 4 个阶段如何在地图中演化。**

[//]: # "At the `Genesis` stage, a new component will have been *kludged* together from existing components or assemblies of existing components - a minimum viable prototype [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level) if you will. For example, according to Arthur (2009 p. 131)[^arthur2009], the first [cyclotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron) was assembled from parts that included a kitchen chair, a clothes tree, window glass, sealing wax and brass fittings!"

在`开创阶段`，一个新组件会由现有组件或现有组件的装配件拼凑在一起——如果你愿意，可以把它想成是一个最小化可行产品的原型。例如，根据亚瑟(2009.131页)[^arthur2009] 的说法，第一个[回旋加速器](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron)由包括厨房椅子、晾衣架、窗户玻璃、密封蜡和黄铜配件在内的部件组装而成！

[//]: # "The new technology, having proven its worth (at least in the mind of the *originators*)[^originators], or having demonstrated that the harnessed principle is *feasible*, then begins its journey along a path of further development."

新技术在证明其价值（至少在发起者看来是这样）[^originators] 或证明所利用的原理可行之后，便开始沿着进一步发展的道路前进。

[//]: # "[^originators]: Following Arthur (2007 p. 279) [^arthur2007] I will call them *originators*, to avoid the lone eccentric connotation of “inventors”. The history of science has many examples of the co-discovery or rediscovery of similar ways to harness a phenomena for a particular purpose - something we will return to in a later blog post."

[^originators]: 根据亚瑟 (2007 279页) [^arthur2007] 我会称他们为*原创者*，以避免“发明者”这个孤立的古怪内涵。科学史上有许多例子，用类似的方法共同发现或重新发现，这些例子都将现象用于特定目的——我们将在稍后的博客文章中再议。 

[//]: # "This is shown by an arrow going left to right in the Wardley Map. During this process the component matures (or evolves) from an initial working technology towards a state that is more reliable, more efficient and more robust. We develop a detailed understanding of its viable operating conditions and this enables us to better understand the cost of delivery and the value it can create."

在 Wardley 地图中，从左到右的箭头表示了技术的发展进程。在此过程中，组件从最初的工作技术逐渐成熟（进化）到更可靠、更高效和更健全的状态。我们详细了解其可行的运营条件，这使我们能够更好地了解交付成本及其可以创造的价值。

[//]: # "The development (or evolution) of the component is ultimately driven by supply and demand competition in the market (or similar mechanism) at different stages of maturity. Along this journey the component technology is often altered and augmented in a variety of different ways."

组件的发展（或进化）最终是由不同成熟阶段的市场供需竞争（或类似机制）驱动的。在这个过程中，组件技术时常以各种不同的方式变化和增强。

[//]: # "Let us, for now, ignore the details of the demand and supply pressures of different markets. We can simply think of a component as existing in several different states over the duration of its evolution. This is illustrated in Figure 2, where we have shown a component in three states during its life-cycle. The initial working technology is in state C[1], at a previous time. C[2] is the current stage of the component and finally C[3] is an anticipated future state [^stages]."

让我们暂时先忽略不同市场供需压力的细节。我们可以简单地认为一个组件在其进化过程中以几种不同的状态存在。这在图 2 中进行了说明，其中我们展示了一个组件在其生命周期中处于的三种状态。最初的工作技术在前一个时间处于状态 C[1]。 C[2] 是组件的当前阶段，最后 C[3] 是预期的未来状态[^stages]。 

[//]: # "**Figure 2. Evolution of a component from past to present to future through different realisations of the technology C[1] to C[3]. At each stage of development the technology must be made reliable, improved, scaled up and adapted to purposes. As we move from states 1-3, engineers can test better techniques, solve problems that have been encountered, and create performance improvements based on different operating conditions.**"
![Figure 2](/assets/zh/2020-01-05/fig02.png)
**图 2. 通过技术 在C[1] 到 C[3] 不同阶段的实现，组件从过去到现在再到未来的演变。在发展的每个阶段，技术都必须可靠、不断改进、扩大规模并适应目的。当我们从状态 1移动到3 时，工程师可以测试更好的技术，解决遇到的问题，并根据不同的操作条件改善性能。**

[//]: # "# Purposed systems"

# 专用系统

[//]: # "Before discussing the behaviour of sets of components in more detail, lets us take a first look at the y-axis of the Wardley Map, labelled *value chain* [^yaxis]."

在更详细地讨论组件集的表现之前，让我们先看一下 Wardley 地图的 y 轴，标记为*价值链* [^yaxis]。 

[//]: # "[^yaxis]: There is ongoing discussion about the structure, and indeed necessity of, the y-axis in a Wardley Map (eg.[Ditch it.](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1146769661297643521)). Whilst there is still a lot to be figured out (and this post skips over many nuances) I think of a map as a projection (mapping) from a high-dimensional space to a lower one. Most commonly we encounter this as going from a 3D real world to 2D cartographers map. Thinking of the 2D Wardley map as a projection into a lower dimensional space is useful - and we are likely to agree in due course on a definition and measurement process for a y-axis (or potentially multiple axes) that has broad utility - I am not in favour of getting rid of it!"

[^yaxis]: 目前关于 Wardley 地图中 y 轴的结构和必要性（[例如弃用它.](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1146769661297643521)）有很多讨论。虽然还有很多需要弄清楚（这篇文章跳过了许多细微差别），但我认为地图是从高维空间到低维空间的投影（映射）。最常见的是，我们遇到的这种情况是从 3D 现实世界到 2D 制图师的地图。将 2D Wardley 地图视为低维空间的投影是有用的 - 我们可能会在适当的时候就具有广泛用途的 y 轴（或潜在的多个轴）定义和测量过程达成一致 - 我不赞成弃用它！。

[//]: # "Consider the example of the jet engine, illustrated in Figure 3."

以喷气发动机为例，如图 3 所示。

[//]: # "The engine is designed to generate thrust to create flight to satisfy a user need. The engine enables us to harness thrust, a physical effect, caused from expanding combusting gas that creates a force we use for movement, the purpose - flying."

该发动机旨在产生推力来创造飞行器以满足用户需求。发动机使我们能够利用推力，这是一种物理效应，由膨胀的燃烧气体产生，创造我们用于运动的力，目的是飞行。

[//]: # "**Figure 3. Example of a simple jet engine. a)  [Schematic of a jet engine](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jet_engine.svg) showing numbered component. The engine consists of an air intake system, a compressor system (to compress the inducted air for combustion), a combustion system (to provide high-energy gas flow for the turbine), a turbine system (to drive the compressor and provide reactive thrust), and an exhaust section (Otis, 1997)[^otis1997].b) A graph representation of the dependancy of different components. Note that Turbine drives the Compressor so we have cycles in the graph.**"
![Figure 3](/assets/zh/2020-01-05/fig03a.png)
**图 3. 一个简单的喷气发动机示例。 a) [喷气发动机](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jet_engine.svg)示意图，显示编号组件。发动机由进气系统、压缩机系统（压缩吸入的空气进行燃烧）、燃烧系统（为涡轮提供高能气流）、涡轮系统（驱动压气机并提供反推力）和排气系统 (Otis, 1997)[^otis1997]组成. b) 这是一个表示不同组件依赖性的图表。请注意涡轮驱动了压缩机，因此我们可以看到图中的循环。**

[//]: # "Observe that if we create a technology, we do so for a reason, a *purpose*. To achieve this purpose we harness a property of the world, a *phenomena*. Arthur's use of the word *principle* refers to the idea of harnessing a phenomena for some purpose.(ibid. p. 2007) I interpret the y-axis of a Wardley Map as linking purposes, via principles, to phenomena. See Figure 4a."

你会观察到，如果我们创造一项技术，我们这样做是有原因，有目的的。为了达到这个目的，我们会利用这个世界的一种属性，一种现象。 亚瑟对“原则”一词的使用指的是为了某种目的而利用现象的想法。（同上，2007 页）我对 Wardley 地图y 轴的解读是通过原则将目的与现象联系起来。参见图 4a。

[//]: # "We can arrange purposed systems in chains of dependencies starting with (user) needs. These needs might be personally or socially perceived - but they are the reason we created the component in the first place - and they sit at the top of the y-axis supported by a set of components and sub-components. It is the nature of technology that, at the end of this chain (or terminating branch) there is always a physical effect or a phenomenon that can be exploited to satisfy it."

我们可以从（用户）需求开始，在依赖链中安排目标系统。这些需求可能是个人或社会的——但它们是我们首先创建组件的原因——它们位于 y 轴的顶部，由一组组件和子组件支持。技术的本质是，在这条链（或终止分支）的末端，总有一种物理效应或现象可以被利用来以满足需求。

[//]: # "Following Arthur (Arthur 2007 [^arthur2007]) we can maintain that each system of components, or *assembly* of components, itself has a purpose - that task that it is designed to carry out. If not, it would not exist. Consequently, technologies are put together or *combined* from component parts or assemblies in a recursive manner[^recursive]. This can be seen with Figure 4c where the engine component is comprises five further technologies and we have rearranged the graph of our engine from Figure 3b to a map in Figure 4c."

继亚瑟(亚瑟 2007 [^arthur2007]) 之后，我们可以认为每个组件系统或组件配件本身都有一个目的 - 那就是它旨在执行的任务。如果没有，它就不会存在。因此，技术以递归方式由组件部件或组件配件组合在一起[^recursive]。这可以从图 4c 中看出，其中发动机组件包括五种进一步的技术，我们已将我们的发动机图从图 3b 重新排列为图 4c 中的地图。

[//]: # "[^recursive]: W. Brian Arthur talks about the recursive structure of technologies, such that technologies consist of parts - assemblies or sub-assemblies - that are themselves technologies."

[^recursive]: W. 布莱恩.亚瑟 谈到了技术的递归结构，例如技术由零件组成——配件或子配件——它们本身就是技术

[//]: # "**Figure 4. Example of a simple jet engine. a) The y-axis of the value chain linking a purpose (flying) to a phenomena (thrust). b) A technology component (an engine) using the principle of combustion to create thrust. It exploits the phenomenon that a mass expelled backward produces an equal and opposite forward reaction. c) The engine at a lower level of abstraction showing numbered components and their dependencies. The x-position of these components is for illustrative purposes [^stages].*"

[//]: # "Chains, or networks, or graphs of components are required to satisfy any suitably involved set of needs and therefore other sub-principles (and therefore sub-components) are required for a technology's practical working. Therefore, as we descend on the y-axis in a Wardley Map we proceed from purposes, through needs and their satisficing assembly of components, to effects and phenomena."

需求链、网络或组件图用来满足适当的需求集，因此技术的实际工作需要其他子原则（以及子组件）。因此，当我们沿着 Wardley 图中的 y 轴下降时，我们从目的出发，通过需求及令人满意的组件集合，再到效果和现象。

[//]: # "Also, note that the phenomenon that are exploited need not only be physical and ``any reliable or repeatable effect from nature, or logic, or behaviour, or organisation may be harnessed for use'' (ibid. pp. 276)." 

此外，要注意的是被利用的现象不仅要是物理的，而且“为了使用，可以利用来自自然、逻辑、行为或组织的任何可靠或可重复的影响”（同上，第 276 页）。

[//]: # "In practise, we will frequently draw a map at a level of abstraction that does not contain purposes and phenomena (and their implied causal inter-dependancies), but focuses on a small set of components."

在实践中，我们经常会在不包含目的和现象（及其隐含的因果相互依赖性）的抽象级别上绘制地图，但会侧重于一小组组件。

[//]: # "# Systems of components"
# 组件系统

[//]: # "As with any real world map, a Wardley Map is depicted at a level of abstraction (and consequent level of detail) to be useful for a particular task. We have seen this briefly when comparing Figure 4b and 4c."

与任何真实世界的地图一样，Wardley 地图在抽象级别（以及随之而来的详细级别）进行描述，以便对特定任务有用。在比较图 4b 和 4c 时，我们已经简要地看到了这一点。

[//]: # "Components are put together or *combined* from other component parts to create *assemblies*[^recursive] of technologies. For our purposes, a map will mean looking at sets of components of specific technologies - and in any particular map some components will be included and some omitted."

组件被放在一起或从其他组件部分组合起来以创建技术组合[^recursive]。就我们的目的而言，地图意味着查看特定技术的组件集 - 在任何特定地图中，某些组件将被包括在内，而某些组件将被省略。

[//]: # "If we go down a level, each of these components is in turn supported, supplied, monitored and controlled by other sub-components: ``the compressor system requires a variable vane actuating system (to set the vane angles appropriately to airflow velocity), and an anti-stall bleed system to control pressure surges (the tendency of the compressed air to blow backwards); the turbine system requires a blade cooling system, and a complicated set of shrouds and seals to prevent high-pressure gas leakage'' (Arthur (2007 p. 277)[^arthur2007])."

如果我们下降一个级别，这些组件中的每一个都依次由其他子组件支持、供应、监控和控制：“压缩机系统需要一个可变叶片驱动系统（根据气流速度适当地设置叶片角度），和防失速泄放系统，用于控制压力波动（压缩空气向后吹的趋势）；涡轮系统需要一个叶片冷却系统，以及一套复杂的护罩和密封件，以防止高压气体泄漏”（亚瑟(2007 277页)[^arthur2007]）。

[//]: # "This is illustrated in Figure 5. Our compressor component iterates from C[0] to C[1] with the addition of anti-stall and vane actuator components and the turbine from T[0] to T[1] with the addition of blade cooling and seals. Note that the relative position of C[0] to C[1] as the component moves to the right as the technology matures."

如图 5 所示。我们的压缩机组件从 C[0] 更迭到 C[1]，添加了防失速装置和叶片式制动器组件，涡轮机从 T[0] 更迭到 T[1]，添加了叶片冷却和密封。请注意，随着技术的成熟，C[0] 与 C[1] 的相对位置随着组件向右移动。

[//]: # "**Figure 5.

For example the compressor transitions from C[0] to C[1], now including an anti-stall bleed system and a new version of the turbine design T[1]. The relative positioning of components on the x-axis and y-axis is for illustrative purposes. Note in these maps we do not distinguish between stages of development on the x-axis.**"

[//]: # "# Focal technologies and the main assembly"

# 焦点技术及整体组合

[//]: # "Let us now turn to the question of what components to include on the map. The user *need* can be represented as a *customer* node at the top of the map. This is supported by a technology designed around the exploitation of some effect, as envisaged through some principle of use."

现在让我们转而关注在地图上包含哪些组件的问题。用户需求可以表示为地图顶部的客户节点。这得到了支持，即围绕利用某种效果而设计的技术，正如通过使用原则所设想的那样。

[//]: # "The method for achieving the purpose, through some *main principle* of use, will be referred to as the *main assembly*. This is illustrated in Figure 6a - and in principle the main assembly can include activities (other forms of capital) as well as technologies."

通过一些主要的使用原理以达到目的的方式，被称为整体组合。这在图 6a 中进行了说明 - 原则上，整体组合可以包括活动（其他形式的资本）以及技术。

[//]: # "**Figure 6. Purposed systems. a) Each component system has a purpose that can be thought of as a chain joining purposes to a principle to phenomena. b) Jet engine with indicative examples of the focal technology and main assembly.**"
![Figure 6](/assets/zh/2020-01-05/fig06.png)
**图 6. 专用系统。 a) 每个组成系统都有一个目的，这些系统连接成一个链，将目的与现象的原理连接起来。 b) 喷气式发动机，带有指示性示例的焦点技术和整体组合。**

In practice, the *main assembly* refers to a core set of components (or methods and activities) that successfully achieve the purpose and allows us to focus a map at the level of a specific task.  Following Adner and Kapoor (Adner and Kapoor 2016[^adnerKapoor2016]) we identify the smallest functional component of the main assembly as the *focal technology*. The main assembly consists of the focal technology and other assemblies that support its working, regulate its function, and feed it with energy. These supporting assemblies require their own sub-components and sub-assemblies: controlling mechanisms, monitoring devices, input and output interfaces and so forth.

In this post we will not pay attention to the detail of the distribution (along the x-axis) of components that make up the main assembly - rather we will focus on the evolution of the main assembly itself from left to right in a manner similar to a single component illustrated in Figure 2.

In Figure 7, we illustrate the evolution of the main assembly for our gas turbine. We can see that it goes from states E[0] to E[1] across different stages of maturity. This is summarised in Figure 7b.


![Figure 7](/assets/en/2020-01-05/fig07.png)
**Figure 7. Evolution of the main assembly. a) Two versions of our gas turbine on the same map. Red dotted arrows show the evolution at a time *i* to *i+1*. b) A short hand summary of [a]. Note the size of the node representing the main assembly increases as the number of components increases.**

With further maturation the technology begins to exhibit variations in deployed solutions and the assembly is subject to usual selection pressures of supply and demand. "The many versions of a technology improve in small steps by the selection of better solutions to their internal design problems... Technologies become more complex - often much more complex - as they mature." Arthur (2009 p.132)[^arthur2009].


# Structural deepening

One mechanism for the increasing complexity in the main assembly is *structural deepening*. This is where the performance limitations of the original *main principle* are overcome with the addition of other sub-principles (and therefore sub-components) to improve the envelop of the technology's practical performance.

Adding sub-systems to work around such limitations drives technologies to elaborate as they evolve - and as sub-systems or assemblies themselves are technologies, and they too develop so they enhance overall performance.

As the engines are pushed to perform at higher temperatures the turbine blades soften as temperatures rise, so a component is added to create new airflow to cool the blades or a component that circulates a cooling material inside the blades themselves. This next stage of evolution is illustrated in Figure 8.

![Figure 8](/assets/en/2020-01-05/fig08.png)
**Figure 8. Evolution of the main assembly. Three stages of development E[0]-E[1]-E[2]. The three stages of the evolution of the main assembly are show as expanded detail with in dotted circles.**

In complex interconnected, interdependent, economies an ongoing source of improvement is that many sub-components are shared across different main assemblies, and therefore a great deal of development happens as components evolve in other adjacent assemblies.

In some technology examples, the components of the main assembly are integral to the device itself. This is the for example in the case of the jet engine. In other cases, the components are external to a device but form part of the operating context or wider environment. Take the case of the alternatives to the use of the internal combustion engine for the car. Fuel cells, or similar, will not pose a real substitute until they are augmented by sufficiently rich set of complementary components that constitute a developed hydrogen infrastructure.

Armed with the notion of a main assembly we are going to look at the dynamics of technology substitution on a Wardley Map.  

# Summary

* Components evolve. (As do our purposes and our knowledge of phenomena.)
* Components can be combined to create purposed systems
* We can think of a system of technologies as chains of components from purposes, via the principles they embody, to phenomena.
* We can select a level of abstraction in a Wardley Map based on the identifying the focal technology and the main assembly.
* Structural deepening describes the observation that as the main assembly evolves it gets more complicated with the addition of components - left to right in a Wardley Map.

***

# Where next?

We are interested in using a Wardley Map to look at the evolution of components. This allows us to think strategically about how a set of components can continue to provide support for a given purpose - or how they may be substituted as better alternative assemblies originate.

Next we'll draw a key distinction between the ***as-developed*** performance of a focal technology, and the ***as-used performance*** of the technology which depends additionally on the components which must co-develop as part of the main assembly.

I'm going to try and use a few different technology examples, including photo-lithography and natural language processing (NLP).

However, before we get to that we'll have to look at the y-axis again in a bit more detail! I'll do this is the next post.
